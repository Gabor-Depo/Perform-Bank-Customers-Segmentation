# Perform Bank Customers Segmentation

Marketing is crucial for the growth and sustainability of any business.
Marketers can help build the company's brand, engage customers, grow revenue, and increase sales.
- GROWTH (Marketers empower business growth by reaching new customers)
- DRIVE SALES (Marketers drive sales and traffic to products/services)
- EDUCATION (Marketers educate and communicate value proposition to customers)
- ENGAGEMENT (Marketers engage customers and understand their needs)

One of the key pain points for marketers is to know their customers and identify their need. By understanding the customer, marketers can launch a targeted marketing campaign that is tailored for specific needs. If data about the customers is available, data science can be applied to perform market segmentation.
